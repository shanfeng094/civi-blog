	# This line mounts Monologue's routes at the root of your application.
	# This means, any requests to URLs such as /my-post, will go to Monologue::PostsController.
	# If you would like to change where this engine is mounted, simply change the :at option to something different.
	#
	# We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Monologue relies on it being the default of "monologue"
	mount Monologue::Engine, at: '/' # or whatever path, be it "/blog" or "/monologue"
